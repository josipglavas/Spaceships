# Spaceships
Spaceship multiplayer game in unity

My first unity project that utilizes Netcode for GameObjects.

This project is an ongoing work-in-progress that showcases the dynamic potential of modern game development. It employs the powerful concepts of object-oriented programming and utilizes C# interfaces to create a versatile gaming experience.

Key Features:

  Multiplayer Support: I've integrated the Netcode for GameObjects library, making the game multiplayer, allowing players to compete in real-time.

  Input Variety: The system seamlessly supports mouse and keyboard input, as well as controller support, providing players with the flexibility to choose their preferred gaming input method.

  Event-Driven Interactivity: C# events are used extensively to enhance interactivity and responsiveness throughout the game.

  Organized Code Structure: The project boasts an organized folder structure, facilitating code and asset management for future enhancements and additions.

Challenges:

  WebGL Limitations: Unfortunately, this project cannot be hosted online due to limitations imposed by WebGL. However, it remains accessible for local play and testing.

My Interactive Spaceships game is made with passion, continually evolving as it nears completion. It offers a rich blend of programming concepts and a multiplayer experience that aims to captivate players in a dynamic virtual world.
